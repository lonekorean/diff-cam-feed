  - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24504476/how-to-deploy-node-that-uses-gulp-to-heroku

- For dev, put .env in root folder, with these contents:
  global.config.PORT = 3000; // do not set in prod (auto-assigned by Heroku)
  global.config.ENVIRONMENT = '';
  global.config.SESSION_SECRET = '';
  global.config.TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY = '';
  global.config.TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET = '';
